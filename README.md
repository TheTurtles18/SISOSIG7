Our project is a social media web application made for facial hair lovers.  With it, users can share their facial hair (or lack thereof) and crowd source their answer to the ever-pressing question of 'Should I Shave Or Should I Grow?'

When creating this project we decided to utilize the MEAN stack - MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js.  

After familiarizing ourselves with these technologies, we used the Agile work flow,taking turns as Project leader, to divy up and track work.  We utilized Trello to keep track of when goals were set, and made sure to check each other's code for Quality Assurance.  

As our app requires the storage of images in the database, we had to use GridFS and multer in conjuction with MongoDB to get around Mongo's 16MB restriction.

When creating the front end of our site, we decided to use pug and angular for our view engine.  The decision about pug was made to keep the site as javascript pure as possible.  Angular and express were used in conjunction to make posts.  The URL contains the pipeline requests.  To store all information about posts and people, we used one database with multiple collections.

We successfully completed our weekly checkins with Alana.
